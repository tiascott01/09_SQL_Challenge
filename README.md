# 09_SQL_Challenge
Overview
This repository contains a two correlating SQL files (Schema and Query), a "Queries" folder with exported CSV files, and a "Resources" folder for the corresponding csv's for importing into PostgreS or PgAdmin4, and an Entity Relationship Diagram. The directions for the module were to use SQL to pull data into a schema and then run queries against it, creating exported data.

Results
In the 09_SQL_Challenge, this dataset is an SQL query of 6 different resources. A schema was created to create individual tables in SQL and then create primary and foreign keys which "appends" data together via columns in each table. In order to run specific queries against the schema, a Query.SQL file was created to further analyze the data in regards to specific conditions. Once the query had been run, a corresponding CSV was exported to a Queries folder and labeled per the query number. Finally an Entity Relationship Diagram was created to address which files were used and their relationship to each other. In the diagram, the Primary Keys are noted next to the table line and the Foreign Keys are noted as the lines which tie each relationship together.

Usage
You can use this method to analyze the data in the corresponding resource CSV's.

Open the respective file (`Schema.SQL) in PostgreS or PgAdmin4.

Upon opening the Schema file, run .

Cells requiring the API key will not work without the key.

Run individual cells within the (`WeatherPy.ipynb) to see the calculations of breakdown by category.

Results will be exported from the notebook into another outbound folder.

After all the cells are run the notebook will be finished.

Open the respective file (`VacationPy.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.

Make sure that the resource and analysis directories are congruent within their respective places as listed in the script, if not change the location.
